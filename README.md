# ***I'm EfanzeDev***

<p>I'm an independent game developer that mainly works in Godot.<br>I specialise in programming and directing creative projects.</p>
<p></p>My main goal is game development - specifically programming - but I'm branching out towards music. I plan to make my games free (or at least super cheap), and earn income mainly from digital soundtrack sales.</p>
<p>I believe in open source software being the new norm for personal and business ventures, and hope to contribute to free-and-open-source projects.</p>
<p>I'm an inexperienced hobbyist, looking for work.</p>
